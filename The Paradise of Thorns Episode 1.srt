1
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,666
Which tree is the flower blooming on?

2
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,416
I'm also wondering.

3
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,833
The scent is really strong around here.

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,750
Hey! Sek. I found it!

5
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,833
It's here! Right here.

6
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,000
- Where?
- Here.

7
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,208
- Right there!
- Found it!

8
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,791
We finally did it!

9
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,583
- We did it!
- Sek, we did it!

10
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,916
MONTHONG KAM-SEK DURIAN ORCHARD

11
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,875
It was really worth all the work,
wasn't it?

12
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,708
Sek, thanks for enduring everything.

13
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll quickly save up
to pay off your last installment.

14
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,583
This land here
will finally be in your name, Sek.

15
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,791
Our first durian bloom.

16
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,875
Let's get married.

17
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,500
OK?

18
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,625
Was thinking of loving a good person

19
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:26,000
Ready to go through the heartbreaks

20
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,500
Of course, can I ask?

21
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,708
Will you be my girlfriend?

22
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:35,833
YOU'RE TOO LATE, I JUST GOT MARRIED

23
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,833
Why are you rushing
to close the mortgage, Thongkam?

24
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,666
I'd like the deed back.

25
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,958
I want to use it

26
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,250
as a wedding registration for Sek and me.

27
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,500
I really admire you two.

28
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,375
The deed has been
with the co-op since Sek's father.

29
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:10,416
Both of you worked hard
to pay back the full amount.

30
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,958
I hope that the soil there is fruitful.

31
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,166
May you have bountiful durian harvests.

32
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,291
LAND OF DEED

33
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,916
REGISTERED OWNERS

34
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,291
MR. SEKSAN BOONKAMLUE

35
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,791
Where, Sek?

36
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,750
- Here?
- Yeah.

37
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,500
Enough already.
You'll get neck cramps again.

38
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,333
I found another bloom!

39
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,500
Here.

40
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,958
That's 30.

41
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,458
What?! Mo! Mo!

42
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,666
What, Mom?

43
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,250
Hurry, will you, Mo? I have to sign papers
for Sek to get an operation.

44
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,041
The truck is with the village head.

45
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,833
He won't be back soon. Mom, hold tight!

46
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:54,916
Sadhu.

47
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,250
May the Lord Buddha
protect and save Sek's life, please.

48
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,458
Mom, hold on.

49
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,750
Someone's here. Stop!

50
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,000
- Sir.
- Stop, please.

51
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,125
Please.

52
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,041
Pupil 5 mil.

53
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,375
Doctor, sir. My husband's mother
was just able to find a ride.

54
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,458
It will take three to four hours
for his sister

55
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,583
to bring her down here, Doc.

56
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,833
Can't we go ahead with the operation

57
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,250
and let his mom sign the papers later?

58
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,583
Like I said,

59
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,791
the patient's brain
is slightly hemorrhaging.

60
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,083
We still can wait.

61
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,750
If we do the operation on him now,

62
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,250
the risk will still be 50-50.

63
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,875
Worst case scenario,

64
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,708
he could end up in a vegetative state.

65
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,625
Doctor. Please let me sign the papers.

66
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,791
I'm begging.

67
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,000
- I'm really his husband, Doc.
- No, please don't do this.

68
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,125
- Don't you believe me?
- Get up first.

69
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,791
I could be his nephew,
his aunt, his uncle, his cousin.

70
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,208
I can be anything!

71
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,375
Doctor!

72
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,500
Look!

73
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,541
- We just screwed, see?!
- Hey! No, no.

74
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,583
- Doctor!
- Calm down, sir.

75
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,208
Mo.

76
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,791
Mom, hold on.

77
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,541
Wait… He was stable just a moment ago.

78
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,166
The patient is in cardiac arrest.

79
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,500
Call code blue.

80
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,708
Start CPR.

81
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,000
THONGKAM KHANLONGSUK AS WITNESS

82
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,083
RELATION: FRIEND OF PATIENT

83
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,500
Thank you, sir.

84
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,750
You didn't get to live comfortably.

85
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,750
Sek.

86
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:08,583
In your next life,
don't be reborn as my child.

87
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:12,000
That way, you won't
have to have a hard life.

88
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,291
Mom.

89
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,416
Sek's gone peacefully already.

90
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,333
Sek.

91
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,375
Here's Sek's ring.

92
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,375
Hold on to it, Mom.

93
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,250
SEKSAN BOONKHAMLUE

94
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,250
Stretch up.

95
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,750
Higher, higher.

96
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,250
Great job.

97
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,416
Now, lift your arms up and lower them.

98
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,291
Slowly.

99
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,750
Lower them. That's good.

100
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,666
Raise them again. Again.

101
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,416
High up.

102
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,666
Raise them.

103
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,166
OK.

104
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,666
Does it ache?

105
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,041
Here's your meds, Mom.

106
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,041
I'll put them here, OK, Mo?

107
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,666
And here's Sek's money.

108
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,250
From Sek's savings.
I've withdrawn all of it.

109
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,916
Thank you, son.

110
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,750
Does Sek only have 10K in savings?

111
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,625
Well…

112
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,416
these five years,
we haven't made any profit yet.

113
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,750
Like you know, some months,
Sek wasn't able to give any money.

114
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,708
But you don't need to worry.

115
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,458
I will definitely take care of you.

116
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,125
I'll take you to the hospital
every month just like Sek did.

117
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,833
Good boy.

118
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,416
Bye.

119
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,833
Mom, the car's here.

120
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,208
Get in.

121
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,750
- No.
- Why not, Mom?

122
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:24,958
I don't want to go.
I want to stay at the hospital, Mo.

123
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,833
Who knows if Sek's ghost is here or not.

124
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:33,000
Why doesn't he visit me?
I want to stay here.

125
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,166
Don't be stubborn.
Are you going to sleep here or what?

126
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,083
Or could it be…

127
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,833
that Sek's ghost is at
his durian orchard, huh?

128
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,125
Then which tree could he be at?

129
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,708
I want to go to where he is.

130
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,291
Please.

131
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,250
Do you want to sleep
at Sek's for a night then?

132
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,250
Could we, Thongkam?

133
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,416
She hasn't come to terms about Sek, yet.

134
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,708
At least it'll help
her stop missing him some.

135
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,916
Sure.

136
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,166
Let's go then.

137
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,375
Mom, come on.

138
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:31,166
TURN LEFT
TO MONTHONG KAM-SEK DURIAN ORCHARD

139
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,000
Whoa, it's a really big orchard.

140
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,375
Are you able to do it all alone?

141
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,833
No matter what, I have to, Mo.

142
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,375
Or else, Sek would be disappointed.

143
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:49,875
Careful, Mom.

144
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,375
And when will you be able
to sell all of it?

145
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,458
In another four months.

146
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,583
After selling,
I'll recoup all what I invested in.

147
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,958
As for Sek's share,

148
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,791
I'll give it to you every year, Mom.

149
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,875
You can renovate your house,
just how Sek intended.

150
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,166
Oh, Mom. Do you remember Jingna,
my younger brother?

151
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,375
I think we should have him
come and help out here.

152
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,208
Mmm, I remember.

153
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,583
Yeah, bring him in.

154
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:20,208
So, we don't have to waste money
to hire others.

155
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,375
It's fine, Mom.

156
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,458
There isn't a place for him to sleep.

157
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll hire someone from around here
on a daily basis. It's easier.

158
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,916
- Ugh.
- OK.

159
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,333
Mom.

160
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,875
It's the birds.

161
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,208
They like to steal bananas
and drop them on the roof.

162
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,041
Ahh.

163
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,875
The roof is made of tin, Mom.

164
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,000
I see.

165
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:49,541
I'll move things and lay down
a mattress for you two.

166
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:53,625
Thanks.

167
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:58,500
But…

168
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,916
Do you have a room with a bed in it?

169
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,583
Mom's been sitting in the car for so long.

170
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,500
I'd like her to lie down for a bit.

171
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,250
There's only Sek's and my bedroom.

172
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,041
How is it, Mom?

173
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,916
Sek slept in this spot, right?

174
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:36,625
Yes, Mom.

175
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:41,250
He's always put on baby powder.

176
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:49,375
Could I sleep here?

177
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,416
I want to be near him.

178
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,708
Sure.

179
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,375
Then, I'll go sleep in the next room.

180
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:02,208
Let Thongkam sleep in that room.

181
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,666
Where else would he sleep?

182
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,208
You. Sleep here with me.

183
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:08,166
If I need anything, I can call you.

184
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,583
You're going to stay
for only one night, right?

185
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:40,041
Let me ask you about something.

186
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:44,416
The land deed includes
the house and the durian orchard, right?

187
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,083
Yes.

188
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,541
Well, Thongkam.

189
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,416
The other day at the funeral,

190
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,166
I met with the village head.

191
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,916
He warned us.

192
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:09,333
Anything that's in Sek's name

193
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,833
should quickly be changed into Mom's.

194
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,625
And this land right here

195
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:19,500
is in Sek's name, right?

196
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:17,541
REGISTERED OWNERS

197
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:18,958
MR. SEKSAN BOONKAMLUE

198
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,750
These aren't substantial evidence.

199
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,583
They're considered
circumstantial evidence.

200
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,083
It's hardly submissible.

201
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,833
You have to understand
that according to the law,

202
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:45,333
you and the deceased
are just like friends.

203
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:49,375
You have to know some of the laws.

204
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,708
The estate will fall into
the hands of the wife, first.

205
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:55,791
Next, the children.

206
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:58,333
If none, then it'll be their mother.

207
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:02,375
In this case,
it falls under his mother's care.

208
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:07,583
And what if his mother dies?
Then who would it fall to?

209
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,541
Well, does he have any other siblings?

210
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,625
Just a non-blood related sister.
His mom took her in.

211
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,208
He doesn't have any other relatives.

212
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,000
Well, she doesn’t have any rights, either.

213
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,625
When his mom dies,
and if she doesn't leave it to anyone,

214
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,083
the land will be returned to the state.

215
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,791
Hey, come on.

216
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,708
So, the law will just give it
to someone else like that?

217
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:27,500
And the joint owner, like me,
doesn't get anything at all?

218
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,208
Blame yourself.

219
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,041
Why didn't you plan better?

220
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:34,333
Couples like you should discuss things
more thoroughly than others.

221
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,500
You think you can really get married?

222
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:44,625
People like us shouldn't be foolish
and give everything to men.

223
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,166
Sek's shirt, Mom.

224
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:24,333
It's hot during the day,
but it's still cold at night.

225
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:43,000
If there's anything you need or want,
you can tell me.

226
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,458
I'll take care of it for you.

227
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:46,666
Don't be shy about it.

228
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,291
But don't take anything
without telling me, OK?

229
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,125
It'll make me uncomfortable.

230
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,208
All of this is Sek's, anyway.

231
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:05,375
My son's possessions are also mine.

232
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:09,875
Even a child will forever be a parent's
possession for as long as they live.

233
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:27,166
I was wondering.

234
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,666
Are you planning to take this land?

235
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,041
Sek and I have built it all together.

236
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:43,750
Really?

237
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,166
But Sek told me

238
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,458
that he's the one who planted
every single tree on his own.

239
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,291
Sek put in the work.

240
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,625
But I'm the one who put in the money.

241
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,291
This land right here,

242
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,208
I'm the one who paid back the loan.

243
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:03,041
I paid both the principal
and the interest all by myself.

244
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,166
This house… I sold my house
in Chiang Mai to build it.

245
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:11,958
If Sek isn't around anymore,
it should be mine, Mom.

246
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,166
I don't know

247
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:18,375
what you and Sek agreed on.

248
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,958
But what I do know

249
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:25,125
is Sek's dad gave him this land.

250
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,041
And as Sek's no longer here,

251
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:34,375
the law says everything is mine.

252
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,666
That's what I believe.

253
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,333
How about this, Mom?

254
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,916
You just…

255
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,041
sign the deed over into my name.

256
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,500
And why even go through all that hassle?

257
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,791
You can just live here like before.

258
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:55,541
No one's going to kick you out anywhere.

259
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,208
Mom.

260
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:07,708
I've spent five years doing this orchard.

261
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:12,125
I don't have any other possessions.
All I have left is one rickety truck.

262
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,708
Please, sympathize with me.

263
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,833
Please, Mom.

264
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,916
You said you spent five years
building this place.

265
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:30,000
But I've spent
more than 30 years caring for Sek.

266
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,833
But he had to die this way.

267
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Have you ever thought

268
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,708
how much I'd be in pain and loss?

269
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,541
I've never spent
a day in my life in comfort.

270
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:48,000
I had to harvest cabbage with my hands

271
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,250
and fill up the truck every day,

272
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,666
until I fell off from the cliff,

273
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:58,000
making me a cripple like this.

274
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:12,958
Mo.

275
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,166
Mo.

276
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,208
Mo!

277
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,750
Help lift yourself up for me.

278
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,500
Put your stuff under the house.

279
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,833
Don't eat too many noodles.

280
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:57,916
I'll make a big pot of curry for you.

281
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,166
Sure.

282
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:32,583
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

283
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:40,666
Hey!

284
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,833
You jerk.

285
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:54,041
Why the hell are you cutting
the water shoots?

286
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,041
What are you talking about?

287
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,041
It's just the branches.

288
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,708
You ass!

289
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,333
They're durian fruits!

290
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,333
Don't you know how to grow durian?

291
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,875
What the hell are you doing?

292
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:24,666
How much is it for one fruit?

293
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,250
You don't need to pay me. I don't want it.

294
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:30,750
Just go tell your sister I don't like
people messing with my durians!

295
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,833
I'm not going to pay you.

296
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm going to pay Auntie Saeng.

297
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:48,375
Come on, guys!

298
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:49,958
Get down, get down.

299
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:53,291
We're here. Let's get it on!

300
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:55,458
Till dawn.

301
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,750
Nine, double score!

302
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,708
Hey, listen.

303
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,291
Hey!

304
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,583
If you were loud like this
back in Chiang Mai,

305
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,541
my dad would call the cops on all of you.

306
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,291
Mo!

307
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,000
Is it too loud for you?

308
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,541
Just one night, OK?
It's not often my friends visit.

309
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,708
It's fine.

310
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:28,750
Mom likes to listen to music anyway.

311
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:29,791
Be my guest.

312
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,083
Let's go, Mom.

313
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:17,583
Sorry, Mom.
I have to deliver these at the market.

314
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:20,000
I'll need to pay
the utilities for this month soon.

315
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:25,208
Mo, take Mom over to the main road
and take the yellow truck taxi.

316
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:28,416
Get off at the city center, go through
the market. The hospital's right there.

317
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,916
Mo.

318
00:39:58,875 --> 00:39:59,875
Mo!

319
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:16,541
Mo.

320
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,083
Hey! What the hell!

321
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,625
Stop it! Damn you!

322
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:32,958
Hey! Stop!

323
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:36,750
What the hell are you doing?!

324
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:37,791
- Where are you taking all this?
- It's mine!

325
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,833
I don't want you to use it.
I'm keeping it at the temple.

326
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,333
This is what you call stealing!

327
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,208
Hey!

328
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:46,416
Just how lucky are you
that Mom is letting you stay here.

329
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,208
How dare you steal?

330
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:51,125
You're the thieves, stealing my home!

331
00:41:58,916 --> 00:41:59,791
Hello. I'd like to report.

332
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:01,875
Someone's breaking into my house.

333
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm terrified…

334
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:06,958
What the hell?

335
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,500
What the hell are you doing?!

336
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,875
Huh?

337
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:12,000
- Why are you taking my stuff?!
- Stop it!

338
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:15,208
- What did he do to you, Mom?
- He took my ring.

339
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,875
You think you had it rough,
so you're entitled to everything?

340
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:17,833
Give it back.

341
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:19,625
I bought it. It's my money.
Why do I have to give it to you?

342
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:21,291
- I said give me the ring!
- It's mine!

343
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,916
But it belongs to my son.

344
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,750
You pierced your nose like a buffalo.

345
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:28,250
That's why
you couldn't understand anything.

346
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:31,041
This ring here,

347
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:35,750
you make it seem as if it's a nappy
Sek had since he was a baby.

348
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:39,125
- Before Sek died, had you ever seen it?
- I could be your mother!

349
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,083
Watch out! You'll go to hell.

350
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:43,250
A person like you is full of sin.

351
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:46,708
In your last life, you must have stolen
someone's wife or something.

352
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:48,875
That's why,
in this life, you're like this.

353
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:50,875
If you were born a normal woman,

354
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,541
then Sek probably wouldn't have died.

355
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:53,958
There you go again!

356
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,208
All you do is blame karma.

357
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:59,541
That's why you're a cripple
and couldn't help Sek in time.

358
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,958
Get off my bed! Dammit!

359
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:04,500
- Mine!
- I told you to stop!

360
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:07,458
- Thongkam! I told you to stop!
- Jingna.

361
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:10,833
- Stop!
- Let go of me, jerk!

362
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:26,625
You're free to go.

363
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,416
The complainant left
your truck here last night.

364
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:41,583
Just think of it as making merit
for the spirits, son.

365
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:43,625
Move in with me here.

366
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,791
There's a lot of work to do in Taipei.

367
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:47,916
You can help me take care of the elders.

368
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:52,166
It's better than staying
at that li'l motel.

369
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,250
And why do I have to give in, Mom?

370
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,875
You can also get married here.

371
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,541
Who knows? You might meet a good person.

372
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:05,250
You still have choices
in your life, you know.

373
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:08,833
Why do you have to make life difficult?

374
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:12,958
All that's left of my life
is the durian orchard.

375
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:18,250
It reminds me just how much
Sek used to love me.

376
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,250
No matter what, I have to win.

377
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:29,625
After consideration of the evidence
from the prosecution and defendant,

378
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,291
the evidence is inconclusive

379
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:35,916
of the plaintiff being the co-owner
of the deed in question.

380
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,541
The court dismisses the case.

381
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:47,541
Thank you for the court's decision.

382
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:52,541
This is proof that there really
is justice in this world.

383
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:57,333
Let's go home.

384
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:07,083
Mr. Sek's birth certificate.

385
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:09,125
His death certificate.

386
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,833
And where's the land deed?

387
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,250
Mom.

388
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,291
LAND DEED

389
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:19,416
See?

390
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:24,875
Look. It's your name.

391
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:27,083
REGISTERED OWNERS
MRS. SAENG BOONKAMLUE

392
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:29,375
Good, good.

393
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:46,083
TWO KM
TO MONTHONG "MOTHER SAENG" DURIAN ORCHARD

394
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,875
500 M
TO MONTHONG "MOTHER SAENG" DURIAN ORCHARD

395
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:07,666
TURN LEFT
TO MONTHONG "MOTHER SAENG" DURIAN ORCHARD

396
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:30,458
I'm here to apologize, Mom.

397
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:38,875
I'm sorry for being extremely rude to you.

398
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,083
Living elsewhere made me realize

399
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,166
just how good it is
that you let me stay here.

400
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,583
- I don't have anywhere else…
- Mom, here.

401
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:01,000
Let me light it for you.

402
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:12,291
Please let me take care
of the orchard here.

403
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:16,208
All I ask for is a place to sleep and eat.

404
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:26,958
The durians are getting bigger.
It'll be difficult to look after them.

405
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:29,291
Have you taken care
of full-grown durians before?

406
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:30,958
Sek taught me everything already.

407
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:35,333
Those fertilizers and pesticides,
I also have a truck to pick them up.

408
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:40,916
Don't fall for it, Mom.

409
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,791
You can tell he's got bad intentions.

410
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,500
I don't have a grudge against him.

411
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:50,291
Also, you did a lot of bad things to Mo.
Ask her for her forgiveness.

412
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:51,958
So we can put things behind us.

413
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:03,666
Good.

414
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,333
Let's think of us as close-knit.

415
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,250
I'll help you no matter what.

416
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,000
You can stay and work
the orchard here, OK?

417
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,041
Mom.

418
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,125
Come on!

419
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,875
Thank you, Mom.

420
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:40,333
MONTHONG "MOTHER SAENG" DURIAN ORCHARD

421
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:48,000
Mom, you're the only one
who can't see through him.

422
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:49,375
He wants revenge.

423
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:52,083
As if someone like him
doesn't have anywhere to go.

424
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:54,458
Do you think I'm stupid?

425
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,958
Why don't you have him
teach Jingna the ropes?

426
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:01,375
When Jingna knows how things work,
you can then kick him out.

427
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:03,875
And the following years,

428
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:05,750
we can just do it ourselves.

429
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:40,666
Hey.

430
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,166
Hey.

431
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,291
Can I sleep inside the net?

432
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,208
Mom.

433
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:05,000
Where are you going? I'll drop you off.

434
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:21,208
Higher.

435
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,291
Stretch up higher.

436
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:30,541
Wow, Mom. They have an electric one now.

437
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:32,333
Do you want it?

438
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:39,916
But I can't part with this one.

439
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,041
You don't have to throw it away.

440
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,666
Mo can keep it as a keepsake.

441
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:46,916
How long has Mo been
pushing this one around?

442
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,666
I think ever since I couldn't walk.

443
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,416
It'd be around 20 years I guess.

444
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,333
Twenty years? Whoa!

445
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:58,583
I totally forgot that you took Mo in.

446
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:02,166
She's been around for so long,
as if she's a part of the family.

447
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:07,875
Wow, you don't need any help.

448
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,166
Here, let me take a clip of you.

449
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,416
Round in circles.

450
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,125
Wow, so nice.

451
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,750
New wheels.

452
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:35,166
Mo.

453
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:37,500
Mo.

454
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:43,041
Mo.

455
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,041
Mo.

456
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,083
Mo.

457
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:54,583
Mo!

458
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,125
Mo!

459
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,333
Mo!

460
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:22,583
I heard you kept calling for Mo.

461
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:24,083
She's probably taking a shower, Mom.

462
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:26,250
Let me help you.

463
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,875
Mo.

464
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:29,958
Mo!

465
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:31,750
Mo!

466
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,416
Mo!

467
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:37,583
Mom's calling you.

468
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,708
Mom, why won't you let Thongkam help you?

469
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:46,375
No. Come here quickly.

470
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:51,708
Mom's gotten tired of you
quicker than I thought.

471
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:02,166
No matter how much you try to please her,

472
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:04,541
Mom won't give it back to you.

473
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,500
In the end,
the one who she loves and trusts…

474
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:10,916
is me.

475
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:20,833
I know I'm just her son-in-law
and have no right to hope for anything.

476
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,541
But you are not her real daughter either.

477
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:27,916
Are you hoping?

478
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:34,416
Have you forgotten
that you're just the help?

479
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:10,125
Turn on this one first,
then these ones here.

480
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:11,958
Remember it.
You'll have to do it yourself.

481
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:13,541
Every other day, OK?

482
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,208
Too much water,
the trees will shed off the fruit.

483
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,583
Sek told me
the small fruits fall off easily.

484
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:31,083
When you spray the pesticide,

485
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:33,791
you need to be above the wind.

486
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,041
Don't let it get into your face.

487
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:41,458
Cover up well. The pesticide is dangerous.

488
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:43,791
Sek once got covered in it.
He almost couldn't breathe.

489
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,916
If you don't kill them, they'll come back.

490
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,125
These caterpillars think
the durians are their nests.

491
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:05,875
Sek had to deal with them
at the old orchard.

492
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:07,875
If you don't kill them,
the entire orchard will be ruined.

493
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,500
You seem to really love him, huh?

494
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:14,958
You haven't stopped talking about him.

495
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,625
Did he even love you half as much?

496
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:23,125
He told me he loved me as much
as every single tree and leaf.

497
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:25,375
And you believe him, huh?

498
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:54,416
Did a caterpillar get you?

499
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,750
Don't scratch it.

500
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:57,958
Take your shirt off.
I'll mix some salt water for you.

501
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:12,083
I said don't scratch.

502
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,041
Tell me about Mo.

503
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:30,250
Was she really close to Sek?

504
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:36,875
Why do I have to tell you?

505
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:05,250
Want something in exchange?

506
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:38,333
You don't wanna know.

507
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:55,000
He already had your sister.
Why did he do this to me?

508
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:03,125
A husband…

509
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:07,333
for work and money.

510
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:12,583
A wife to take care of his mom.

511
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:19,166
Sek used to make cabbage leaves
bouquets for me every day.

512
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,166
Lots of them were rotted and thrown away.

513
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:27,166
It's funny.

514
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:31,041
You're a woman.

515
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,458
If he really loved you,
why didn't he marry you?

516
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,083
You'd have everything by now.

517
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:45,166
Is my single durian flower more valuable
than the entire wall of your bouquets?

518
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,416
Are you sure…

519
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:52,000
that the land deed
you think is your marriage certificate

520
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:53,916
means he truly loved you?

521
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,583
He was just luring you into
giving him money to marry his wife.

522
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:49,083
Do you really throw away
all the deformed fruits?

523
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:51,583
These small ones have flesh you can eat.

524
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:54,375
You have to be strong-willed
when growing durian.

525
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:56,875
They'll just use up
the food from the others.

526
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:58,875
It's better to just burn them
and make charcoal.

527
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:05,333
I've meant to keep the nice ones
for you to sell, about 4,000 of them.

528
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:08,416
Mom, look at that guy, over there.

529
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:11,500
He's Meng, my old boss.

530
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,833
He's going to give us…

531
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:16,000
160 baht for a kilo, Mom.

532
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:18,541
Altogether, it'll be…

533
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,666
two million. How does that sound?

534
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:37,708
But before I sell them,
there's one more thing I want to do.

535
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:42,500
Sek wanted to be ordained
as a tribute to you, right?

536
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:47,791
I'd like to be ordained in his place.

537
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:05,000
Let me be your other son, Mom.

538
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,416
Get on.

539
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:21,416
Come on.

540
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,875
I won't let you fall off.

541
01:08:50,583 --> 01:08:52,375
Focus on your temple duties.

542
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:56,666
I'll fertilize the durians for you.

543
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,291
Today, I've been ordained in your name.

544
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:34,125
I hope later, you'll accept me
as your actual son.

545
01:09:37,291 --> 01:09:38,500
So, I can look after you forever,

546
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:41,583
take care of your orchard,
and earn millions for you every year.

547
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:44,750
You can rest assured that someone
is taking care of Sek's orchard for you.

548
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:47,125
I'll take it on after you.

549
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:55,333
Sonny, you can
prove it to me first this year.

550
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:58,500
If you can do as you say,

551
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:01,583
I'll accept that you're my son.

552
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,458
Turn them all on.

553
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:57,375
Hey! Let all the fruits fall off.

554
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:02,208
One fruit is worth more than my wage.

555
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:05,166
If he's able to sell the durian

556
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,166
and claim the orchard back,

557
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:10,458
do you really think
he'll let us stay here?

558
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:12,416
Do you think he will?

559
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:15,333
Just thinking that I might lose

560
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:18,000
makes me feel like I'm going to explode.

561
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,166
Whenever you were jobless,

562
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,166
I always shared Sek's money with you.

563
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:42,208
I brought you here to live comfortably.

564
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:46,000
Do you want to go back
to sleeping in a forest?

565
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:48,083
Huh?

566
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:52,541
Don't you feel sorry for Thongkam?

567
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:05,791
Ever since I've been born,

568
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,958
I've never seen anyone
as pitiful as myself.

569
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,416
Who else do you want me

570
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:13,916
to take pity on?

571
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,625
I've been wanting
to visit Mom for a while.

572
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:01,791
I'm finally here.

573
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:27,458
Why's the dirt so wet?

574
01:13:29,083 --> 01:13:30,958
Have you been turning on
the water like I've taught you?

575
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:34,250
The water's been
forming puddles like this lately.

576
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:37,208
Maybe the watering time
needs to be changed.

577
01:15:14,416 --> 01:15:15,916
My durians are almost ready to harvest.

578
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,041
Meng, please sympathize with me.

579
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:21,125
I've lost a lot of durians.
There's only around 3,000 of them left.

580
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:23,625
Could I ask for 200 a kilo, please?

581
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:25,666
Or else, I won't be able
to make two million.

582
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,750
It's not like I don't
want to help you out.

583
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:31,666
But if you're asking me
to increase the price from 160

584
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:34,250
to 200, it'll be too much.

585
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:39,041
I'm sorry,
but I'll have to take back my offer.

586
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:44,375
Can l take 100 of them, first?

587
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:46,958
If you're asking me to buy out
the entire orchard,

588
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,833
I don't think that'll be possible.

589
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:52,416
I have to save money
to buy other fruits as well.

590
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:58,583
Come on out to the front, everyone!

591
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,333
Come on out.

592
01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:05,333
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Rocket Festival

593
01:16:05,416 --> 01:16:12,250
Today we have Mr. Tang, the Deputy
District Chief, as our guest of honor.

594
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:14,791
Oh, I heard there's
going to be a storm today.

595
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:16,458
It was on the news.

596
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:20,083
But I'm afraid it'll be scattered rain.

597
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:22,541
A rocket as large as this one,
it'll lunge high for sure.

598
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:25,083
The angels' eyes and ears
will probably hurt even.

599
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:26,916
Yeah, the rocket is huge.

600
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,041
Do the durians
have to use a lot of rain water?

601
01:16:31,041 --> 01:16:32,666
There's been a drought this year.

602
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,458
If it rains, it'd help.

603
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,375
Sweetie.

604
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:40,500
Are you the owner of a durian orchard?

605
01:16:41,541 --> 01:16:46,500
Mr. Tang, are you curious
about the orchard or the owner, really?

606
01:16:46,583 --> 01:16:48,125
Why don't you stop by and have a taste?

607
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:25,541
Hey!

608
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:26,958
Hey!

609
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:28,083
Hey!

610
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,208
I'm just hanging them as I see fit.

611
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:54,791
There are a few trees left.

612
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:01,000
You hang the lower branches then.

613
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:02,666
It's all wet. You'll slip.

614
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:04,041
I'll climb up myself.

615
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:43,708
I'm sorry.

616
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:50,458
Mhm.

617
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:53,750
It's fine.

618
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:56,625
I really am sorry.

619
01:20:57,958 --> 01:20:59,333
Yeah, that's enough.

620
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:23,791
I'll help you take care of the orchard.

621
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,541
And afterwards, I'll take Mo and leave.

622
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:56,458
If I get the orchard back,

623
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,916
I want you to stay here with me.

624
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:23,708
All right, Mom.

625
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,083
Let's go.

626
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:37,250
Stop playing around.

627
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:40,458
Come on. Stop playing around.

628
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:45,083
Hey.

629
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,458
Everyone, this durian here
is the monthong breed.

630
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:57,875
Inside, there are five…

631
01:23:57,958 --> 01:23:58,875
UNKNOWN CALLER

632
01:23:59,458 --> 01:24:00,833
- Hello?
- Hello.

633
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:02,750
Is this Mother Saeng's Durian Orchard?

634
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:03,916
Yes.

635
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,583
I'm calling from Uttaradit.

636
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,458
A storm hit and ruined my orchard.

637
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:09,583
Could I buy out your orchard?

638
01:24:09,666 --> 01:24:10,750
What?! Are you serious?

639
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:13,875
Yes. Save the entire orchard for me, OK?

640
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:15,916
Shit!

641
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,125
- Shit!
- What?

642
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:20,333
LONG-LIN LAPLAE DURIAN, UTTARADIT

643
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:22,500
I really must thank you.

644
01:24:23,708 --> 01:24:26,166
The storm took out
all the durian orchards up north.

645
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,583
Hardly anyone was able to tie them down.

646
01:24:28,666 --> 01:24:29,875
Your orchard's the only one left.

647
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:32,333
If it weren't for you, I'd be in trouble.

648
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:34,333
Here, this is the deposit for half of it.

649
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:37,416
Next time, I can just wire you the money.

650
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,708
No need to come all the way here.

651
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:41,083
Well then, next month,

652
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:42,666
I will have my guys go cut the fruit

653
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,583
along with the rest of money.

654
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:47,666
Tell your mom, all she has to do
is wait and count the money.

655
01:25:04,375 --> 01:25:06,291
- Mom.
- Mmm.

656
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:09,291
This is it.

657
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:11,250
Let's go inside.

658
01:25:13,416 --> 01:25:15,000
Let's see what's inside the mall.

659
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:20,375
What are you thinking, bringing me here?

660
01:25:20,458 --> 01:25:23,208
Well, we made the effort
to move into the city.

661
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:25,750
I'd like to take you around.

662
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:28,458
But I only have the means
to take you here.

663
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:29,583
Do you like it?

664
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:34,791
Pick anything you want to eat.
It's my treat.

665
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:38,625
Here, Mom.

666
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:40,125
- Huh?
- Looks good.

667
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:00,375
- Mom.
- What?

668
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:03,166
Jingna told me that he knows
how to take care of the orchard.

669
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,416
When are you going to kick Thongkam out?

670
01:26:07,875 --> 01:26:09,291
If he leaves,

671
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:12,625
then who will negotiate the prices for us?

672
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:15,875
You didn't go to school.

673
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,625
You can't sell them like he does.

674
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:25,458
You know, I think we should live
comfortably like this. It's all good.

675
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:01,333
It's taking forever.

676
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:02,958
What's all the wishes?

677
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:08,541
I wish to be with you
for a long, long time.

678
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:15,791
- I don't believe you.
- Well, then ask the angels yourself then.

679
01:27:15,875 --> 01:27:17,750
- Come on. Don't play around.
- Really.

680
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,666
- Tell me.
- For real.

681
01:27:21,916 --> 01:27:24,000
Come on. What was it?

682
01:27:26,666 --> 01:27:28,041
I wish to get the orchard back.

683
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:33,708
To take care of the orchard
with you every day.

684
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:36,958
What about you?

685
01:27:40,958 --> 01:27:42,458
I didn't know what to ask for.

686
01:27:43,416 --> 01:27:45,416
So, I asked for your wish to come true.

687
01:27:53,916 --> 01:27:55,041
Over there.

688
01:27:55,625 --> 01:27:57,041
They said, walk all the way up there.

689
01:27:58,291 --> 01:27:59,791
And your wish will be granted.

690
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:16,583
Come on.

691
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:18,458
Make a wish.

692
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:20,916
Umm…

693
01:28:23,416 --> 01:28:24,666
There has to be something
you want to wish for.

694
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:25,583
None.

695
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:27,000
Come on. Everyone has at least one wish.

696
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:28,333
Just one.

697
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:31,000
Hurry, make a wish. Do it.

698
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:34,291
Then, I wish for you and Mo to be happy.

699
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:36,166
I hope one day, you two can live together,

700
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:37,583
don't fight with each other,

701
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:42,000
and become a family, please.

702
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:05,625
I WISH FOR US TO LIVE HAPPILY TOGETHER
THONGKAM, JINGNA, SAENG

703
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:19,458
AND MO

704
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:36,791
MAE HONG SON DISTRICT OFFICE

705
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:55,458
Mom.

706
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:03,291
Would you let me be your daughter?

707
01:30:06,083 --> 01:30:07,333
Please, Mom.

708
01:30:10,041 --> 01:30:12,041
Let's go in and sign the documents, OK?

709
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:54,916
Carry me up inside the house.

710
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:05,375
- I told you to carry me up inside!
- No.

711
01:31:05,958 --> 01:31:07,583
Not until you understand.

712
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:10,375
If anyone were to receive
anything from you, it should be me.

713
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:14,125
I came before Thongkam, Mom.

714
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,666
I've never been born into any merit
or fortune like the others.

715
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,250
Can't you give some of your merit
to your daughter-in-law?

716
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:59,041
Sign over the house and the land
to me right here, please.

717
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:01,541
I'm begging you, Mom.

718
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,500
I've already asked the village head.

719
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:18,416
He said all you need to do
is sign your name and write the date.

720
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,791
Stating that you're giving it to me.
That's all.

721
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:34,666
I promise that I won't leave you ever.

722
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:35,916
Please.

723
01:32:45,666 --> 01:32:48,250
Did I ever tell you that I accept you
as my daughter-in-law?

724
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:23,916
Do I need permission to be someone's wife?

725
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,750
I don't see you seeking permission
to be a Mom.

726
01:33:32,791 --> 01:33:34,291
Sign it, Mom.

727
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:35,791
Sign it!

728
01:33:35,875 --> 01:33:36,708
I told you to sign it!

729
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:40,000
Sign it! Ouch!

730
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,083
Mo. What are you doing, Mo?!

731
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:56,125
Stop now, Mo!

732
01:33:56,208 --> 01:33:57,500
Mo, dammit! I said stop!

733
01:33:57,583 --> 01:33:58,666
Riding on the hill like this,

734
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:02,541
I really wanna know just how useful
this electric wheelchair is without me!

735
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:04,125
Fine! If you're all that, just leave!

736
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:06,000
No one's stopping you!

737
01:34:06,083 --> 01:34:07,791
But you have nowhere to go.

738
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:09,750
That's why you're stuck with me!

739
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:12,000
Well, when I did have somewhere to go…

740
01:34:13,458 --> 01:34:17,083
wasn't it your son who didn't let me go?

741
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:22,500
I told Sek that I wasn't going to stay.
I was going to work in Bangkok.

742
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:27,166
He then tricked me into being his wife
and made me take care of you.

743
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:29,291
So, who was it who held me back?

744
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:30,833
Then go file a lawsuit,

745
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:32,875
saying you were tricked
into being my son's wife.

746
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:34,958
The court might sympathize with you.

747
01:34:35,041 --> 01:34:37,416
If you win,
I'll sign everything over to you.

748
01:34:41,916 --> 01:34:44,500
Then stay here
and watch over your beloved orchard!

749
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:49,291
- What are you going to do, Mo?
- Come here.

750
01:34:49,375 --> 01:34:50,583
- Don't!
- Come here!

751
01:34:51,166 --> 01:34:52,291
What the hell are you doing?

752
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:54,125
Mo, stop it!

753
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,041
What the hell? Let me go!

754
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:57,208
Stop it, Mo!

755
01:34:58,375 --> 01:35:01,291
Wait for you dearest son-in-law
to come and help you then.

756
01:35:01,375 --> 01:35:03,625
I'm not going to stay
and wipe your ass any longer!

757
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:04,875
Stop it!

758
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:10,416
Leave! If you want to go, then go!

759
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,625
Don't you ever come back, Mo!

760
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:13,958
Go!

761
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:15,833
Go!

762
01:35:19,916 --> 01:35:21,208
Mo, you ungrateful wench!

763
01:35:22,541 --> 01:35:24,916
I raised you for 20 years.

764
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:28,416
You gold digger.

765
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,625
No sense of gratitude.

766
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:36,375
Leave and don't ever come back.

767
01:35:36,458 --> 01:35:38,583
I hope you starve to death.

768
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:43,125
If you want to go, go.

769
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:44,208
Leave.

770
01:35:44,291 --> 01:35:47,250
But don't you take anything with you.
Not even a single piece.

771
01:35:59,625 --> 01:36:01,666
That shirt you're wearing is also mine.

772
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:04,791
You have nothing but yourself.
No one's going to take you in.

773
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:01,916
Mo.

774
01:37:02,916 --> 01:37:05,333
Mo! I give in!

775
01:37:05,416 --> 01:37:06,958
I'll do what you want.

776
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:09,708
Mo!

777
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:23,500
Mo.

778
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:25,666
I signed it for you.

779
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,000
Mo.

780
01:37:28,083 --> 01:37:31,666
I've already signed it for you, see? Mo!

781
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:57,666
Mo!

782

798
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:35,375
Mo, don’t leave me.

800
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:59,208
Help me.

AUGUST 20, 2023. SAENG BOONKAMLUE

01:42:35,208 --> 01:42:36,416
LONG P'IT

805
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:11,791
LONG P'IT

806
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,833
If Mother Saeng were still alive,

807
01:43:28,916 --> 01:43:31,708
she would be proud of her daughter

808
01:43:32,458 --> 01:43:35,708
who gets to marry a government official.

809
01:43:37,708 --> 01:43:42,000
There's no shame
going out with him in public.

810
01:43:42,083 --> 01:43:45,625
When you get sick
and are admitted to a hospital,

811
01:43:45,708 --> 01:43:47,791
everything will be covered.

812
01:43:47,875 --> 01:43:50,125
When he retires,

813
01:43:50,208 --> 01:43:54,208
there's a pension
that you can spend until your last day.

814
01:43:54,791 --> 01:43:56,541
For today's dowry,

815
01:43:56,625 --> 01:43:59,958
the groom has prepared
over a million baht cash.

816
01:44:01,125 --> 01:44:03,416
It's money that the couple earned

817
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:07,625
from growing durian
together up to this day.

818
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:10,125
Tomorrow,

819
01:44:10,208 --> 01:44:12,291
we're going to be harvesting the durians.

820
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:14,958
If you don't have any money, that's fine.

821
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:17,166
I'm giving them out for free.

822
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:54,875
Do you love me?

823
01:44:57,416 --> 01:44:59,166
Will you go with me wherever I go?

824
01:45:02,625 --> 01:45:03,750
You don't have to leave.

825
01:45:05,958 --> 01:45:07,458
Stay with me here.

826
01:45:12,916 --> 01:45:14,750
Stay and live off durian together.

827
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:19,041
You can live here with Mo.

828
01:45:22,291 --> 01:45:23,583
I'll talk to her.

829
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:45,791
Will you marry me?

830
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:21,791
Let's congratulate them together.

831
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:24,333
Let's count.

832
01:46:24,416 --> 01:46:28,625
One, two, three.

833
01:46:41,208 --> 01:46:44,458
- So, is the groom handsome?
- Yes.

834
01:46:44,541 --> 01:46:47,083
- What about the bride? Is she pretty?
- Yes.

835
01:46:47,166 --> 01:46:50,041
Let's give them a big hand.

836
01:46:50,125 --> 01:46:51,250
Congratulations.

837
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:53,791
And for the next step,

838
01:46:53,875 --> 01:46:56,000
we have an official
from the district office

839
01:46:56,083 --> 01:46:59,125
conduct the wedding registration.

840
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:08,833
THONGKAM KHANLONGSUK

841
01:47:25,583 --> 01:47:27,666
THONGKAM KHANLONGSUK & JINGNA JONGYOI

842
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:33,791
As of now, the two are now
legally husband and wife!

843
01:47:38,875 --> 01:47:40,750
- Jingna.
- Hmm?

844
01:47:45,958 --> 01:47:47,958
You once said
that all of this is mine, right?

845
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:52,875
Yeah.

846
01:47:57,250 --> 01:48:00,000
Even if everyone in the world
were to say it isn't,

847
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:04,791
but I know that it's yours.

848
01:49:02,458 --> 01:49:05,333
Jingna, do you want to sleep in the house?

849
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:34,041
Thongkam, you bastard! You thief!

850
01:50:35,291 --> 01:50:36,958
I'm going to call the cops.

851
01:50:46,333 --> 01:50:48,041
I won't let you take anything!

852
01:50:48,958 --> 01:50:50,583
Hey, the durian!

853
01:50:51,458 --> 01:50:53,041
Dammit!

854
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:06,291
The durians are falling into the water.

855
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:07,916
Jingna, go fetch them.

856
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,083
The pulp will be ruined!

857
01:51:13,791 --> 01:51:14,750
Jingna!

858
01:51:14,833 --> 01:51:16,166
Go into the house.

859
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:18,125
If you help him,

860
01:51:18,708 --> 01:51:19,666
I hope you

861
01:51:20,291 --> 01:51:22,416
are met with misfortune
just like Thongkam and Sek!

862
01:51:25,458 --> 01:51:26,916
Yeah?

863
01:51:28,291 --> 01:51:30,875
You want to kill me
just like you killed Sek?

864
01:52:28,625 --> 01:52:29,583
Because I know…

865
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:34,416
that this orchard is in Sek's name.

866
01:52:35,625 --> 01:52:37,291
And if he damn well dies,

867
01:52:37,375 --> 01:52:40,375
you won't get anything!

868
01:52:43,083 --> 01:52:44,125
Fine!

869
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:47,583
If I don't get anything,
then you won't either!

870
01:52:49,541 --> 01:52:50,541
Thongkam.

871
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:52,166
Thongkam!

872
01:52:57,583 --> 01:52:59,166
Thongkam!

873
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:05,833
Thongkam!

874
01:53:05,916 --> 01:53:07,041
Thongkam!

875
01:53:12,375 --> 01:53:15,166
What are you doing to my orchard?
You bastard!

876
01:53:16,708 --> 01:53:18,875
- Stop right now!
- It's mine!

877
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:20,583
I built it with my own hands.

878
01:53:20,666 --> 01:53:22,041
I can do whatever the hell I want to!

879
01:53:22,125 --> 01:53:23,958
If you want it, go grow them yourself!

880
01:53:48,541 --> 01:53:50,958
- You asshole!
- Damn you!

881
01:53:51,041 --> 01:53:53,875
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

882
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:56,916
What the hell is wrong with you?!

883
01:53:57,750 --> 01:54:00,333
Let go of me. Let me go!

884
01:54:04,208 --> 01:54:05,958
I'm going to kill you!

885
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,583
Let me go! Let go of me!

886
01:54:27,375 --> 01:54:28,958
There's no way you'll ever beat me!

887
01:54:29,041 --> 01:54:32,000
I'm going to live in your house
and your orchard with my husband!

888
01:54:32,083 --> 01:54:34,375
Let it be in my name until the day I die.

889
01:54:34,458 --> 01:54:37,333
Because even if you die, there will
never be a day it'll be in your name!

890
01:54:37,416 --> 01:54:38,708
Then let it be in the name of my child!

891
01:54:38,791 --> 01:54:39,666
What the hell?

892
01:54:40,666 --> 01:54:42,166
Let go of me!

893
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:43,166
Let go of me!

894
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:44,625
No!

895
01:54:46,625 --> 01:54:47,916
Let go of me.

896
01:54:49,875 --> 01:54:51,041
Let go of me!

897
01:54:51,833 --> 01:54:53,041
What the hell are you going to do?

898
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:56,000
You aren't leaving me
with any other choice.

899
01:54:56,916 --> 01:54:57,875
Let go of me!

900
01:54:57,958 --> 01:54:59,541
Stop destroying my life.

901
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:02,625
You bastard! Let go of me!

902
01:55:02,708 --> 01:55:05,041
You're an asshole just like Sek. Damn you!

903
01:55:05,125 --> 01:55:06,625
Let go of me!

904
01:55:07,291 --> 01:55:08,708
Let go of me!

905
01:55:10,375 --> 01:55:13,000
He never loved me. He loved you!

906
01:55:26,291 --> 01:55:28,375
He never loved me.

907
01:55:30,083 --> 01:55:33,083
He loved you. Are you satisfied?

908
01:55:52,083 --> 01:55:54,333
Stop destroying my life.

909
01:55:59,541 --> 01:56:01,916
Can we not break up?

910
01:56:03,333 --> 01:56:05,875
I can give you a child, Sek.

911
01:56:07,375 --> 01:56:09,666
Please, I'm begging you.

912
01:56:10,583 --> 01:56:13,000
I have only you.

913
01:56:13,083 --> 01:56:15,625
Don't leave me, please.

914
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:18,458
Please.

915
01:56:19,416 --> 01:56:21,291
- Mo.
- Sek, just don't leave me.

916
01:56:24,958 --> 01:56:27,083
I have no one else.

917
01:56:27,166 --> 01:56:29,416
Mo. I bought you a wallet.

918
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:31,708
My savings are in there.

919
01:56:33,083 --> 01:56:35,083
I've already talked to the cabbage shop.

920
01:56:36,083 --> 01:56:39,750
They agreed to have you look
after their shop in the market.

921
01:56:42,541 --> 01:56:44,916
And you can live
and board with them as well.

922
01:56:50,375 --> 01:56:51,916
Of all my life,
this is all I can give you.

923
01:56:53,166 --> 01:56:54,250
You jerk!

924
01:56:55,333 --> 01:56:58,208
I thought you said you would
trick him into giving us his money?

925
01:57:00,375 --> 01:57:03,750
Do you think this covers
the ten years I've lost?

926
01:57:04,458 --> 01:57:05,666
Answer me!

927
01:57:06,916 --> 01:57:08,833
I said, answer me!

928
01:57:08,916 --> 01:57:10,875
Give me an answer!

929
01:57:12,291 --> 01:57:13,625
I've let you go already!

930
01:57:14,208 --> 01:57:16,416
Go! Go start a new life.

931
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:17,750
Leave!

932
01:57:17,833 --> 01:57:19,791
How could you do this to me?

933
01:57:19,875 --> 01:57:21,000
Sek!

934
01:57:23,208 --> 01:57:25,458
How could you do this to me?

935
01:57:25,541 --> 01:57:26,750
Sek!

936
01:57:29,625 --> 01:57:31,041
Sek!

937
01:57:36,458 --> 01:57:38,250
Come back.

938
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:03,000
If you want this orchard,

939
01:59:05,291 --> 01:59:06,291
then take it.

940
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:12,875
I'll compensate on Sek's behalf.

941
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:24,500
But I'm going to leave with your brother.

942
01:59:34,041 --> 01:59:35,291
Damn you!

943
01:59:37,625 --> 01:59:39,083
Asshole! Bastard!

944
01:59:39,166 --> 01:59:40,333
Tang! Stop!

945
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:43,791
Tang! I said stop!

946
01:59:43,875 --> 01:59:45,208
What the hell's with you?!

947
01:59:45,291 --> 01:59:46,750
How dare you mess with my wife?

948
01:59:46,833 --> 01:59:48,458
I'll kill you!

949
01:59:50,833 --> 01:59:53,000
- Stop!
- She's my wife!

950
01:59:53,083 --> 01:59:55,125
This is my orchard!

951
01:59:55,208 --> 01:59:57,541
- Don't even bother living!
- Tang!

952
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:02,291
- Tang!
- Mine!

953
02:00:03,541 --> 02:00:05,125
Shit!

954
02:00:07,916 --> 02:00:10,583
Get up.

955
02:00:13,708 --> 02:00:15,000
Breathe.

956
02:00:15,083 --> 02:00:16,250
Breathe.

957
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:24,083
Breathe.

958
02:00:30,583 --> 02:00:31,791
Dammit!

959
02:00:32,875 --> 02:00:34,041
Jingna.

960
02:00:34,125 --> 02:00:35,250
You ass!

961
02:00:35,333 --> 02:00:36,416
Thongkam!

962
02:00:37,291 --> 02:00:38,875
Tang! Don't!

963
02:00:38,958 --> 02:00:40,208
No!

964
02:00:57,375 --> 02:00:58,833
Jingna!

965
02:01:52,833 --> 02:01:54,250
Jingna!

966
02:01:58,875 --> 02:02:00,125
Jingna!

967
02:02:20,291 --> 02:02:21,333
Who are you?

968
02:02:22,166 --> 02:02:23,958
How are you related to this family?

969
02:02:25,666 --> 02:02:28,291
What's your relationship to them?

970
02:03:16,916 --> 02:03:22,458
